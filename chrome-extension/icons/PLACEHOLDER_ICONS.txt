PLACEHOLDER FOR ICON FILES

The following PNG files need to be created and placed in this directory:

Required files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels)  
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

Use the icon.svg file as a source and convert to PNG format.

For testing purposes, you can:
1. Create simple colored squares
2. Use the emoji ðŸ“š as a screenshot
3. Download any small PNG and copy it 4 times with different names
4. Use online SVG to PNG converters

The extension will load without icons, but they improve the user experience.
