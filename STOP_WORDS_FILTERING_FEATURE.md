# Stop Words Filtering Feature

## üìã Overview

The Stop Words Filtering feature improves vocabulary learning quality by intelligently deprioritizing common English words like "the", "and", "is" during word extraction and ranking. This ensures users focus on content-carrying vocabulary that provides real learning value.

### üéØ Key Benefits

- **Improved Learning Efficiency**: Focus on meaningful vocabulary instead of function words
- **Better Word Rankings**: Content words appear before stop words in priority lists
- **Pro Customization**: Pro users can toggle filtering on/off based on their preferences
- **Smart Content Scoring**: Words are scored based on their learning value, not just frequency

## üîß Implementation Details

### Backend Components

#### 1. Stop Words Database (`core/utils.py`)

```python
ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS = {
    # Articles, pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, auxiliaries, etc.
    "a", "an", "the", "and", "or", "but", "in", "on", "at", "to", "for", 
    "of", "with", "by", "is", "are", "was", "were", "be", "have", "has", 
    "had", "do", "does", "did", "will", "would", "can", "could", "should", 
    "may", "might", "this", "that", "these", "those", "i", "you", "he", 
    "she", "it", "we", "they", "me", "him", "her", "us", "them", ...
}
```

Comprehensive list of 200+ common English stop words across all categories.

#### 2. Content Scoring System

```python
def calculate_content_score(word, frequency, filter_stop_words_enabled=True):
    """Calculate content score with stop word penalty."""
    if filter_stop_words_enabled and is_stop_word(word):
        return frequency * 0.1  # 90% penalty for stop words
    return float(frequency)  # Full score for content words
```

**Scoring Logic:**
- **Content Words**: Full frequency score (e.g., "algorithm" with 10 occurrences = 10 points)
- **Stop Words (Filtered)**: 10% of frequency score (e.g., "the" with 50 occurrences = 5 points)
- **Stop Words (Unfiltered)**: Full frequency score (Pro users can disable filtering)

#### 3. User Settings Model

```python
class UserProfile(models.Model):
    filter_stop_words = models.BooleanField(
        default=True, 
        help_text="Filter common English words from priority ranking (Pro only)"
    )
    
    def can_modify_stop_words_filter(self):
        """Check if user can modify stop words filtering (Pro only)."""
        return self.is_pro_active()
    
    def get_effective_stop_words_filter(self):
        """Get the effective stop words filter setting."""
        # Free users always have filtering enabled
        if not self.is_pro_active():
            return True
        return self.filter_stop_words
```

#### 4. Enhanced Word Processing

The `_process_source_words` method now:

1. **Checks User Preference**: Gets filtering setting from user profile
2. **Analyzes Content**: Identifies stop words vs content words
3. **Applies Scoring**: Uses content scoring for priority calculation
4. **Logs Statistics**: Tracks stop word percentages and filtering status

```python
def _process_source_words(self, source, user):
    # Get user's filtering preference
    profile, _ = UserProfile.objects.get_or_create(user=user)
    filter_stop_words_enabled = profile.get_effective_stop_words_filter()
    
    # Process with content scoring
    for word_text, frequency in word_counts.items():
        content_score = calculate_content_score(word_text, frequency, filter_stop_words_enabled)
        # Use content_score for priority instead of raw frequency
        knowledge.priority = int(content_score)
```
