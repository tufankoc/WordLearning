        <p>Welcome to Kelime, your personal vocabulary learning assistant.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-6">How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            This app is designed to help you build your vocabulary from the texts you read.
            You can add any text source—an article, a book chapter, or just a snippet of text—and the app
            will automatically extract the unique words for you to learn.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-4">Spaced Repetition</h3>
        <p>
            The review system uses a Spaced Repetition System (SRS). This is a learning technique that
            schedules reviews at increasing intervals. When you know a word, the app will wait longer
            before showing it to you again. If you forget a word, it will be shown to you more frequently
            until you master it. This method is highly effective for long-term retention.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-4">Manually Adding Words</h3>
        <p>
            If you already know a word and don't want it to appear in your review queue, you can use the
            "Mark a Word as Known" tool on the dashboard. Simply type the word and submit it.
